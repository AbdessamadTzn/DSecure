Data Science in Financial Anomaly Detection

### Project Overview:

This project is an end-to-end fraud detection system built to identify anomalies in transactional data using machine learning. It integrates cutting-edge tools for data visualization, cloud-based workflows, and scalable deployment. The goal is to provide a robust pipeline for analyzing, detecting, and preventing fraudulent activities in banking transactions.

#### Key Features:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Initial analysis and cleaning performed locally for efficiency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive visualization of transaction patterns using tools like Power BI and Dash Plotly.
- Machine Learning Model: A fraud detection model trained to identify anomalies in transaction data.
- Cloud Integration:
  - AWS S3 for data storage.
  - AWS EC2 for scalable training and deployment.
- Docker: Ensures consistent environments across local and cloud workflows.
- API Development: Flask API to serve the trained model for real-time predictions.
- Interactive Dashboard: A Dash Plotly dashboard for end-user interaction and monitoring predictions.

#### Tech Stack:

- Programming: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2)
- Visualization: Power BI, Dash Plotly
- Containerization: Docker
- Deployment: Flask API

#### Current Status:

- _Completed data exploration and visualization_
- _In progress: Cloud integration and pipeline automation_
- _Upcoming: Deployment and interactive dashboard_
